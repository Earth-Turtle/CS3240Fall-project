Created by Team 1-13

## Basic overview
The goal of this webapp is to provide users a way to contact their representatives using user-created templates that other users can comment on.
##  Usage
### Login
Click the top-right green button to login using your Google account. Once logged in, you can click the red button to log out.
### Templates
Once logged in, click the `Templates` button in the top left to access the main portion of the site. There are four categories currently available. Click on the button below any of them to access created templates. Once you've clicked on a template, you can comment on it, or use the template to generate a message. Put the email of your representative in the `Recipient email` box, and we'll send that message to them! (For testing purposes, only put your own email in the recipient box).
### Profiles
From any page on the site, click on "Profile" in the top left. You can add/edit your personal information here, then click "submit" on the bottom to save it.
